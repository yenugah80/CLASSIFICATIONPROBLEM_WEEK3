1. Choose a Dataset
   
Dataset Selection: For this activity, I have used a Iris dataset. It’s a well-known dataset that contains information about iris flowers, including features like petal and sepal sizes, and the type of iris (species) each flower belongs to. I’ll use this dataset to build and test our models.

2. Build and Train Models
Logistic Regression: This model predicts the class by finding the best line that separates different classes.

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): This model classifies data based on the classes of its nearest neighbors. The number of neighbors (k) is a key parameter.

Decision Tree: This model splits the data into branches to make decisions. It creates a tree-like structure to classify the data.

3. Evaluate Models
Make Predictions and Evaluate: Once the models are trained, I will use them to predict the class of the test data and then evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Compare 
Comparison: After evaluating, I got metrics for each model:

Accuracy: How often the model is correct.
Precision: How many of the predicted positives are actually positive.
Recall: How many of the actual positives were predicted correctly.
F1-Score: A balance between precision and recall.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Logistic Regression:
Pros: Simple and fast. Works well if the data is linearly separable.
Cons: May not perform well with complex patterns.

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):
Pros: Simple and effective for small datasets. Can handle complex boundaries.
Cons: Slow with large datasets and high dimensions.

Decision Tree:
Pros: Good for complex data patterns and easy to interpret.
Cons: Can overfit the data and be sensitive to small changes.

Conclusion
By building and testing these models, I have learned how different algorithms perform with the same data. This helps in choosing the best model for a specific problem based on how well they perform.
