building and evaluating classification models using Python. You will use a dataset of your choice to compare three popular classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Decision Trees. You will evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
